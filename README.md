## Exercises

Implement a program that contains `DrawCircle(*ebiten.Image, x, y, r int, c color.Color)` function.
The function must be implemented using integer arithmetics only.

A few OPTIONAL (!) ideas:
1. A circle can change its size over time. Verifies your function works for different radiuses.
2. There can be multiple circles on the screen. Verifies your function works for different center points.
3. Moving circle(s) that bounce off the screen borders. This verifies everything at once.
